# FLAPPYBIRD
Project is based on Java and Swings. The goal is to fly the bird as far as possible without hitting any pipes, which are positioned at different heights on the screen. The game features minimalistic graphics and straightforward gameplay, but it quickly becomes challenging as the speed increases and the gaps between pipes become narrower. Players earn points based on the distance traveled,score is displayed on screen.
